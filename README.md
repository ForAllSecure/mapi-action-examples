## Example GitHub Actions Integration

This repo contains a simple python API that is being tested by Mayhem
for API.

### Starting a Mayhem for API scan in Github Actions

To scan your API with Mayhem for API in CI, you need to:
1) Start your API
2) Start the Mayhem for API scan

In GitHub actions, those steps translate to:

```yaml
    # Run API in test mode. We configured test mode to output stacktraces in
    # the error responses to improve the output of Mayhem for API.
    - name: Run API
      env:
        FASTAPI_ENV: test
      run: uvicorn src.main:app &

    # Run Mayhem for API
    - name: Run Mayhem for API to check for vulnerabilities
      uses: ForAllSecure/mapi-action@v2
      with:
        mayhem-url: https://app.mayhem.security
        mayhem-token: ${{ secrets.MAYHEM_TOKEN }}
        api-url: http://localhost:8000
        api-spec: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
```

This repo contains a [full example](.github/workflows/mapi.yml) for
reference.

# Reports

Mayhem for API generate reports when you pass `sarif-report` or
`html-report` to the input. Make sure to pass `continue-on-error` to the
Mayhem for API step if you want to process the reports in follow-up
steps.

## Artifact HTML Report

![HTML Report](./imgs/sample-report.png)

To artifact the report in your build, add this step to your pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run Mayhem for API to check for vulnerabilities
  uses: ForAllSecure/mapi-action@v2
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    mayhem-url: https://app.mayhem.security
    mayhem-token: ${{ secrets.MAYHEM_TOKEN }}
    api-url: http://localhost:8000 # <- update this
    api-spec: your-openapi-spec-or-postman-collection.json # <- update this
    html-report: mapi.html

# Archive HTML report
- name: Archive Mayhem for API report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: mapi-report
    path: mapi.html
```

## GitHub Code Scanning support

![Mayhem for API issue in your PR](./imgs/sarif-github.png)

Uploading SARIF reports to GitHub allows you to see any issue found by
Mayhem for API right on your PR, as well as in the "Security" tab of
your repository. This currently requires you to have a GitHub Enterprise
Plan or have a public repository. To upload the SARIF report, add this
step to your pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Run Mayhem for API to check for vulnerabilities
  uses: ForAllSecure/mapi-action@v2
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    mayhem-url: https://app.mayhem.security
    mayhem-token: ${{ secrets.MAYHEM_TOKEN }}
    api-url: http://localhost:8000 # <- update this
    api-spec: your-openapi-spec-or-postman-collection.json # <- update this
    sarif-report: mapi.sarif

# Upload SARIF file (only available on public repos or github enterprise)
- name: Upload SARIF file
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  with:
    sarif_file: mapi.sarif
```

If your API server sends back stacktraces in the 500 Internal Server
Error (only do this in a test environment -- never in production!),
Mayhem for API will try to map issues it finds to the exact line of code
that triggered the issue.
